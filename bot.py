    # Uvicorn needs to be run in its own process/loop, so we coordinate with asyncio
    # We will use Uvicorn's server and pass our FastAPI app to it.
    # The application.run_webhook will essentially integrate with the FastAPI app.

    # This part gets tricky because both uvicorn.run and application.run_webhook want to control the event loop.
    # The best approach for p-t-b v20 with FastAPI is to let p-t-b run its webhook server
    # and use FastAPI as the framework it runs on.

    # Re-evaluate: The previous setup with FastAPI and p-t-b run_webhook is a common pattern.
    # Let's ensure application.run_webhook is correctly hooked into FastAPI.
    # The application.run_webhook function in python-telegram-bot v20+ is designed to start
    # a web server (like a Flask/FastAPI one) and handle incoming webhooks.
    # You typically don't run uvicorn.run() *directly* if using application.run_webhook,
    # as run_webhook handles the server setup internally.

    # Let's revert to a simpler and more standard p-t-b v20 webhook setup
    # if it's causing conflicts with FastAPI's direct uvicorn.run.
    # OR we make application.run_webhook use the FastAPI app.

    # The most common pattern for p-t-b v20 webhooks with a custom web server (like FastAPI)
    # is to manually create the Bot object, set the webhook, and then pass
    # the updates received by your FastAPI app *to* the p-t-b application.
    # Your current @app.post("/webhook") does this: `await application.update_queue.put(...)`

    # Let's simplify the main block to correctly run the FastAPI app,
    # and the webhook setting needs to happen *before* the app starts serving.
